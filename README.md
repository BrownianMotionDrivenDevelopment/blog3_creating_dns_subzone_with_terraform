# Creating a DNS Subzone with Terraform

This is the example code for the [blog](https://andyboyle.io/2017/03/24/creating-a-dns-subdomain-with-terraform/)

The premise is you have a domain name you own, say "example.com", and you wish to create a DNS subzone for development work. In this case we can use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and the article goes through the basic steps required.
The code related to this is in this repo, although you'll want to change the DNS name in dns-zone.tf [[[ TODO: link to file]]]
